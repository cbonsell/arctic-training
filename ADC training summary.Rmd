# Problem: 
### **How is someone 5 (or 10 or 20) years from now (i.e. Christina's replacement), or someone not involved with this project going to know how we QA/QC'd our datalogger data?**

# additional problems: 
### how can BLE QA/QC and data analysis be 

### 1. more efficient in general
### 2. more agile in incorporating new data after each season/year

# Why: So BLE data can be widely and wisely used

#Solution:  
 * preserve computational workflows

####Tool I learned that I'm excited about:  
 * GitHub

####Tools I got better at:  
 * Rmarkdown  
 * R data wrangling tools  

####Tools I learned, but probably won't use anytime soon:  
 * DMPTools (but we didn't spend much time on it)

Additionally (importantly), I learned that you can include your QA/QC code into repositories, linking raw datasets to QA/QC derived datasets


###Bonus features  
 * I can quickly send data and QA/QC updates, reports, and summaries to whomever via a web address
 * I learned some handy R functions. Yay code efficiency.
